# Some tests of unrolling the 0.14.0 XOD generated code

See the XOD project in xod-arduino_optimization_test/

# Configuration

XOD 0.14.0
Arduino ID 1.8.1
Compile for UNO

# Stats

We'll compare the standard "generated code" ("Deploy: Show Code for Arduino") with some hand attempts at unrolling. I'll compile for the UNO as a reference, using the Arduino IDE.
